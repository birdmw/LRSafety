Generate a complete and concise checklist with a point system for evaluating turn-around for a climber on the mountain based on the logical combination and combined wisdom of these systems. Ensure that the produced checklist would help the climbers avoid trouble if used. Each section of the final point system should range from 0 to N with the sum across all sections adding up to 0 to 20, with a higher score indicating a stronger need to consider turning around.
